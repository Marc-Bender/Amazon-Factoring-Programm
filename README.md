# Amazon-Factoring-program
Piece of individual code.

It's used to go through a bunch of invoices (as PDF) from one of our customers (online-seller).

It fetches the Invoice number and the Amazon-Order-Number from the PDF-files.

It outputs a CSV-file containing a table showing the Amazon-Order-Number for each Invoice number (if present).

Language: German

Programming Language: Visual Basic .Net (WPF-App)

Prerequisites: needs the tool pdftotext.exe (from the miktex package)

What I learned:

  - basic use of github :-)
  - how to make a basic Progress Bar in VB
  - something about the different types of File-Dialogs 
  - a lot of minor stuff (because i have not used Visual Basic in like 5 years)
